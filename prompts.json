      "prompt": "# VEHICLE DAMAGE DETECTION - BALANCED MODE\n\n## CRITICAL: FULL RESOLUTION PIXEL-LEVEL ANALYSIS\nYou MUST analyze at 100% native resolution with pixel-level inspection. Scan EVERY square centimeter of the vehicle systematically. Small defects disappear at reduced resolution.\n\n## TARGET\n- Inspect ONLY the foreground vehicle\n- Ignore: background objects, other vehicles, people, signs, reflections\n\n## SYSTEMATIC INSPECTION METHODOLOGY (mandatory full resolution)\nUse horizontal line-by-line scanning. Do NOT skip any area. Multiple passes on critical zones.\n\n1. **Bumpers (front/rear)** → zoom 100%, pixel-level scan:\n   - Check for paint chips exposing black plastic underneath\n   - Look for cracks, separation from body panels\n   - Examine entire surface texture at maximum detail\n\n2. **Lower body areas** → zoom 100%, scan every centimeter:\n   - Rocker panels, sills, lower door edges\n   - Check for curb scrapes, deformation, impact marks\n   - Look for bent/pushed metal on bottom edges\n\n3. **Body panels (hood, doors, fenders, trunk)** → pixel-level inspection:\n   - Examine paint condition: loss of gloss vs shiny areas (clearcoat failure)\n   - Detect matte patches, discoloration, peeling\n   - ALL panels must have uniform finish unless by design\n   - Surfaces must be perfectly smooth - any irregularity = damage\n\n4. **Fenders and wheel arches** → zoom 100% around ALL wheels:\n   - Check for scratches, scrapes above/around each wheel\n   - Inspect wheel arch edges for impact damage\n\n5. **Panel gaps and trim** → verify at full resolution:\n   - Check for excessive separation between bumpers and body\n   - Look for lifted/detached rubber seals and moldings\n   - Verify uniform gap widths\n\n6. **Headlights/taillights** → native resolution inspection:\n   - Detect opacity, yellowing, cracks, broken lenses\n\n7. **Windows and glass** → maximum zoom:\n   - Check for cracks, chips\n\n## DAMAGE CRITERIA (mark YES if detected):\n- **Paint chips on bumpers** (exposing black plastic base)\n- **Paint deterioration** (loss of gloss, matte patches, clearcoat peeling/failure)\n- **Scrapes on lower body/rocker panels** (curb damage)\n- **Scratches on fenders/panels** (short or long, shallow or deep)\n- **Deep scratches crossing multiple panels**\n- **Deformation on lower edges** (bent/pushed metal)\n- **Excessive separation** of bumpers, panels, or trim pieces\n- **Lifted/detached rubber seals** or window moldings\n- **Surface irregularities** on panels that should be smooth\n- Dents with surface distortion\n- Cracks in glass/plastic/lights\n- Panel misalignment (noticeable gap variation)\n- Missing parts or components\n- Moderate to heavy rust\n- **Opaque/yellowed/damaged headlights**\n\n## EXCLUDE (not damage):\n- Dirt, dust, mud, water (especially on lower areas and bumpers)\n- Shadows cast by trees/objects (common on white/light vehicles)\n- Glare, reflections, rainbow effects\n- JPEG compression artifacts\n- Stickers, vinyl wraps, decals\n- Normal underbody grime\n- Very minor surface marks <1cm\n\n## DECISION RULE\nApply reasonable judgment based on COMPLETE pixel-level scan at full resolution.\n\n**Critical inspection areas:**\n- Bumpers (paint chips very common)\n- Lower body (curb damage frequent)\n- Paint finish uniformity (shiny vs matte = damage)\n- Fenders around wheels (scratches common)\n- Panel gaps and seals\n\nIf damage is likely present but uncertain → answer \"yes\" (err on side of caution)\nIf clearly no damage or only cosmetic dirt/shadows → answer \"no\"\n\n## OUTPUT\nSingle lowercase word: \"yes\" or \"no\"'"
